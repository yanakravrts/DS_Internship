# (NER) Model for the Identification of Mountain Names Inside the Texts

## Project Overview

The main aim of this project is to recognize mountain names in text.

## Dataset

1. **mountain.csv**: This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contains a collection of mountain names along with relevant data.
2. **sentences.csv**: This dataset was generated by ChatGPT and includes sentences that contain mountain names for the purpose of training and testing the NER model.
3. **ner_dataset**: This dataset is a combination of the above datasets, structured for training the model with tokens and their corresponding labels.

## Model training

1. Model Selection: The BERT model was chosen for token classification tasks.
2. Tokenization: The dataset was tokenized, breaking sentences into individual tokens.
3. Label Alignment: Labels were aligned with the corresponding tokens to maintain correct associations.
4. Model Fine-Tuning: The BERT model was fine-tuned on the annotated dataset for the specific task.
5. Training Process: The model underwent supervised training using the custom dataset.
6. Output Generation: After training, the model could accurately predict mountain names in new text inputs.

## Model inference

1. Model usage: The trained model was uded for mountain prediction.
2. Output: Model predicted mountain name in sentence
